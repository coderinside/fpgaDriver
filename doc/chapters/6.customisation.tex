Users can customise SCAS for their specific application.
Additional registers can be implemented in the global register space by following the coding style and comments in the reg\_file.v verilog source file inside source/pcie\_if directory.
Another requirement will be to have more streaming interfaces to connect additional streaming peripherals.
This can be easily done by instantiating additional PSG and DSG modules (defined in pcie\_stream\_generator.v and dram\_stream\_generator.v).
These modules basically require information such as source and destination addresses, transfer length.
This can be done by implementing additional registers in global register space or in the user logic.
These modules use simple start/done control signals for operation.
They should be then integrated to the PSA and DSA for accessing the PCIe and DRAM cores.
